## Linear regression models
Regression models are widely used machine learning tools allowing us to make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features and continuous-valued outcomes.
In this work I want to show you how it works.

## Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
One of the major aspects of training your machine learning model is avoiding overfitting. And in second part I'll show you how to avoid overfitting.

## Gradient Descent Regressor
Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent.
